I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. i was encouraged to enroll by a former student of their's who can only say wonerful thigs about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project in particular was outstanding it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers 100% recommend."</h6></div>
